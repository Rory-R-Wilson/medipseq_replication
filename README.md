# medipseq_replication

## Background

This code runs analysis for the paper "Genetic variation influencing DNA methylation provides new insights into the molecular pathways regulating genomic function" by Hawe et al. Specifically, it runs the analysis for replicating the HSM-LD block associations from the MeDIP-seq results of Bell et al. (PMID: 29295990).



## Scripts

The R scripts are found in 'code/' and are the two files: 

* step_1_map_HSM_LD_assoc_to_SNP_CpG.r
* step_2_calculate_enrichment_above_bg.R

### Data

The data required for the code are found in 'data/' and are the following:

*

It is possible to completely reconstruct the results from the data found here. However, the data presented here are not raw data. Specifically,
